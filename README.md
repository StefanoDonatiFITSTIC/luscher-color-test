# luscher-color-test
Simplified version of Luscher's color test

You may start the test just by opening index.html

Special thanks to Chris Zarate for developing sheetrock.js
this JavaScript library allowed me to compile the test results
in a google spreadsheet hence avoiding me the tedious task
of writing everything in JSON.
